  # We have a hard-to-track-down bug around invalid addresses with all-nil fields finding
  # their way into the database. I don't know what the source of them is, so this patch
  # is designed to track them down.
  # This is intended to be a temporary investigative measure, and should be removed from the
  # code base shortly. If it's past 17-10-2013, take it out.
